# Sorting-Algorithms
Basic sorting algorithms visualized using console output

IMPORTANT: 1. The program is Windows-specific.
           2. The program uses _getch() from the header file <conio.h>.
           3. I did NOT create the file "colours.h".
           
           
The program generates an array of random numbers, then sorts it with various
sortig algorithms. The sorting part is visualized using basic console output,
where each number is represented with a horizontal bar.
